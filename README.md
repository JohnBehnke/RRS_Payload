RRS_Payload
===========

We are the development team for the Rensselaer Rocket Society. We've built a payload which we are going to put into a rocket which should reach around 10,000-15,000 feet.

The code for the payload is currently a work in progress, and we're also going to build a parser to read that data so we can do stuff with it.

We are using an Arduino Uno right now for the hardware, although we may end up changing what we use.
